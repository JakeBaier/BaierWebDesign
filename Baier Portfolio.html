                    <H5>Have a custom website that is made just for you! Put your company online for more eyes to see
                        and grow
                        your business!</H5>
                    <H6>I enjoy the freedom and creativity 
                        that comes from building websites. 
                        Nothing beats the expression on a customers face when their 
                        vision becomes a reality. Many entrepreneurs want to do just 
                        about everything on their own... even their own website. 
                        Those web development platforms work, but they're generic and it shows.
                        Let me help you build your online presence and have something as unique as you are.</H6>

                        It was a personal project that was started in order to express interest and knoweledge about
                        someone's
                        hobby.
                        It's a good example of using serene colors in a content heavy website.</h5>

                        It's meant to be a simple guide for tourists in which it highlights the best of what Nashville
                        has
                        to offer.
                        Using subtle transitions and a well-thought-out color pallete, I think we accomplished
                        an eyecatching platform that showcases restaraunts worth eating at.</h5>
